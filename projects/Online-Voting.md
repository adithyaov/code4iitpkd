Voting is an integral part of Democracy and the year being 2019
it is important to give communities power of anonymous and safe
online voting. 

## Project

This project will be divided into various parts and each part will
require a different set of skills and experience.

Parts,

1. Safe Backend API
2. Command line application
3. Web application
4. Mobile application
5. Advance security

### Safe Backend API

This is the most important part of the project. This would require
some background on cryptography and blind signatures. It is quite
simple and straightforward to learn the cryptographic concepts.

Once you know the concepts of blind signature it is simple and
straightforward to implement a working backend.

Please [check this repository][sample-voting] for a sample working backend.

This can be done in any programming language of choice.

You will need to somehow take care of attacks like DoS and DDoS.


### Command Line application

The reason I propose this is to create a simple frontend which
interacts with the server. This can be used for some quick results.
You can consider a backend with the command line application a near
complete online voting.

This can also be done in any programming language of choice.

### Web application / Mobile application

This can be created at the end, maybe after a secure backend a
command line application is created.

You will need to learn technologies like, react, flutter, etc.

### Advance security

This is highly advance. You will need to perform penetration testing
etc. to guarantee the stability and security of your software.

This is required if you want larger communities on millions of people
be able to use your software.

**Part 1 and Part 2 have the highest priority**
